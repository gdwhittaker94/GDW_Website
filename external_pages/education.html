        My programming education consists of a mix of self-education, online courses, and a bootcamp. Although initially I thought I would be able to teach myself programming without any outside help, eventually I realised that learning programming <i>with</i> outside help would be a lot easier and a lot faster than without it!

        My programming journey began by watching Youtube videos, following free online courses and using resources like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="">W3 schools</a> as a guide as to which topics to learn and when.

      <p class="paragraph">
        After many months like this, I attempted to get my first official qualification in programming and decided to do two modules of the online <b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer" target="_blank">META (Facebook) Frontend Professional Developer Certificate</a></b>. In these modules I enhanced my knowledge and understanding of both Javascript and Version Control (Git/Github) through a series of lectures, practical exercises and quizzes.

        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Completing these modules gave me more confidence, but I was eager to know more and deepen my knowledge. So I spent some more time studying HTML, CSS, Git, Github and JavaScript on my own but also, crucially, started doing some projects to put what I was learning about into practice.

        However, I now often found myself stuck programmatic problems or with an error I didn't know how to fix and that's when I realised that learning by myself had its disadvantages! So in the summer of 2023 I enrolled onto a full-stack developer course with the award-winning <b><a href="https://4geeksacademy.com/us/awards">4Geeks Academy</a></b>.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This course was a 4-month long intensive program in order to teach students the fundamentals necessary in order to be a full-stack developer. The course started with Frontend development, looking at the following technologies: <i>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jest, React, Git/Github, and APIs</i> (interacting with them). Then we moved over to the Backend, looking at: <i>Python, SQL, SQL Alchemy, Flask, and APIs</i> (creating out own).

      <p class="paragraph">
        During the course I completed 18 individual projects, with a final team-based full-stack app utilising agile methodology. Many of these projects can be seen in the projects section of the home page, as well as on <a href="https://github.com/gdwhittaker94" target="_blank">my Github page</a>.
