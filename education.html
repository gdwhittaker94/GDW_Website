          I am a self-taught web developer. Call me crazy, but yes, I have basically taught myself everything I know about web development!
          These days you often seen advertised bootcamps or courses that last a couple of months, cost X thousands of dollars, and promise to turn you into a professional developer and find you a job as soon as you finish them. It's not that I don't believe them, but from I knew from the start that I didn't want to learn that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this point in my life I have a good understanding of who I am and how I work, and I know that when I learn something new I like to make notes ... lots of organised, <span class="red">c</span><span class="blue">o</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="purple">o</span><span class="red">u</span><span class="blue">r</span><span class="green">f</span><span class="purple">u</span><span class="red">l</span> notes! This takes a lot of time - something that a typical 3 month bootcamp/course time-frame doesn't seem to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          With web development, from the beginning I had an idea that there was a lot to learn (<i>little did I actually know!</i>). Furthermore, I knew that all the concepts and information I would be learning would be completely new and quite alien to me. Therefore, I didn't want to be hastily rushed from one topic to another, with little time to really absorb all his new information, and then be shoved into a professional environment expected to go from day 1!
        </p>
        <p>
          So I taught myself web development. I must admit that doing it this way has been hard at times, and now I can see the appeal of courses where you struggle alongside other newbies and you get to ask professionals to help you when you get stuck, but I'm still happy with the decision I made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below there is a link to my personal collection of notes on all the topics I have studied. One big advantage of being self-taught is that when I found something hard or difficult to understand, I had the time to really work through it, process it, and eventually explain it to myself in a way that made sense.

            During winter 2022/2023 I completed two modules of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer" target>META (Facebook) Frontend Professional Developer Certificate</a>. In these modules I enhanced my knowledge and understanding of both Javascript and Version Control (Git/Github) through a series of lectures, practical exercises and quizzes.

            They're not perfect, and there's still much to do, but working through all the new topics and information in this way has been tremendously helpful to me in understanding this complex new world of web development. What's more, it's a permanent library of information that I find myself going back to again and again in order to remember X thing or help myself when I get stuck while programming.
