          I am a self-taught web developer. It seems to be the done thing these days to do a bootcamp or even a university-backed course in order to learn web development. Although tempting, I ultimately decided not to do one of these courses when starting, and here's why.
        </p>
        <p>
          When learning something new, I like to take notes ... lots of detailed, organised, <span class="red">c</span><span class="blue">o</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="purple">o</span><span class="red">u</span><span class="blue">r</span><span class="green">f</span><span class="purple">u</span><span class="red">l</span> notes! This is a time and effort-intensive process.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main concern with bootcamps and courses was the short time-frame they advertised - typically around 3/4 months. Before I properly started learning about web development I already had an inkling that there was going to be a lot to learn (<i>little did I actually know!</i>) , and that a lot of what I was going to learn was going be hard, complex, and quite different from anything I had learned before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I wanted to give myself the best chance of learning and understanding all this new information properly, give myself the time and freedom to explore new topics and concepts in-depth, and to of course make detailed, organised, colourful notes about it all! Not to be rushed from one day or one week to the next, going from topic to topic to topic without really giving myself time for the information to sink in.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, that's what I've done! And I think it was worthwhile. Being self-taught is not an easy route, and I recognise it has it's disadvantages in comparison to cohort-based courses. However, I believe that although I haven't received the same formal education and training as those that have done such courses, this doesn't diminish in any way the quality of my education, and I believe my notes (which can viewed below) attest to that.

            During winter 2022/2023 I completed two modules of the online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer" target>META (Facebook) Frontend Professional Developer Certificate</a>. In these modules, which I completed by myself, I enhanced my knowledge and understanding of both Javascript and Version Control (Git/Github) through a series of lectures, practical exercises and quizzes.

            Below is included a link to my own personal collection of notes on web development and different topics such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Version Control.

          <p>
            Although I'm very proud of them, I admit there's still more work to do and more topics to cover. However, making these notes has helped me tremendously teach myself web development, and what's more they now serve as a constant reference point which I can go back to in case I ever get stuck of forget important bits of information while carrying out real projects.
